## Overview

This branch contains the source code for the script sections that ecf.py generates. I wanted to keep it separate in order to keep the tool reasonably lightweight.

This contains:

* A python script which will generate the traffic
* A powershell script that will generate the traffic
* A C# application that will generate the traffic (compile using `csc MWR.cs`) on mono
